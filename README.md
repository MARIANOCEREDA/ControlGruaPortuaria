# Automata and Discrete Control - Port Crane Control System

This is the repository for the Final Project of "Automata and Discrete Control" â€š

*Topic:* Port crane control system

*Goal:* Development and implementation of a hybrid control and protection automation for semi-automatic operation for a coordinated operation on a port gantry dock-mounted container crane.

***Stages:*** 

- A) Design, conceptual modeling and performance analysis using Model-in-the-Loop simulation (Stateflow - Simulink);
- B) Implementation in an industrial industrial automation programming environment according to IEC 61131 standard (CODESYS) and Software-in-the-Loop co-simulation (CODESYS - Simulink communicated via OPC UA).  via OPC UA).

***

### Control Levels

***Level 0: Safety and protection ->***  consists of a smaller and more reliable automaton, which must take control in case of critical failure and/or safety risk. 

***Level 1: Global supervisory control ->*** Event-driven discrete-state, hierarchically structured and/or concurrency, for smooth and efficient operation with path coordination and optimization, global system operation control and diagnostics (alarms and faults).

***Level 2: Motion Controllers ->*** Discrete-time continuous state controllers are responsible for receiving individual motion commands from the supervisory control for direct control of each of the main hoisting and translation motions.

### Tech Stack

*Proposition*

- CODESYS V3.5 SP17 == PLC programming for Control levels 0 and 1.
- Matlab,Simulink == Simulation of the physical model and Control Level 2.
- OPC-UA protocol == Communication between CODESYS and Matlab.
